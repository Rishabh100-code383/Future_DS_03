# Future_DS_03
A Power BI dashboard project created as part of the Data Science & Analytics internship at Future Interns.
This project analyzes road accident data to identify key patterns, high-risk zones, and safety insights for public awareness and policy planning.

Objective
To design an interactive Power BI dashboard that:

Identifies high-risk locations and accident hotspots

Analyzes accident severity, trends, and conditions

Highlights contributing factors like light, weather, and road type

Assists stakeholders in making data-driven safety improvements

Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: For data modeling, visualization, DAX, and dashboarding

Python (Pandas): For preprocessing and EDA

Excel: For initial data inspection and output

Dashboard Features
✅ Key Visuals

KPI Cards: Total Accidents, Casualties, Fatalities
📍 Map Visual: Accident density and geographic hotspots

🚦 Pie/Donut Charts: Accident severity, urban vs rural split

🛣️ Bar Charts: Casualties by vehicle, road, light, and weather conditions

🔍 Slicers: Year, road surface, weather conditions, and severity filters
